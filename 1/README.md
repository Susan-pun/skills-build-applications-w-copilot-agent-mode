# Healthcare Worker Engagement Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of the COMP1001 â€“ Programming Principles and Techniques module (Assessment 2). The goal is to design and implement a Python-based software application that analyzes and visualizes employee engagement and attrition data from a healthcare organization.

The application includes a user-friendly interface, performs data processing operations to summarize key insights, and generates visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and dashboards.

## Objectives

- Load and process healthcare employee data from a CSV file.
- Summarize information such as department distribution, age statistics, gender ratio, work-life balance, and attrition count.
- Visualize employee distribution and status using charts.
- Provide an interactive GUI using Python's Tkinter library.

## Key Features

- Text-based GUI using `tkinter`
- Data loading and summary generation using `pandas`
- Data visualization using `matplotlib`
- Code debugging and version control with PyCharm and Git
- Modular and readable Python code following best practices

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Pandas (data handling)
- Matplotlib (visualizations)
- PyCharm (development and debugging)
- Git & GitHub (version control)
